Welcome to the Calgary arithmetic coding corner.  Here is the code for
arithmetic coding and decoding that was published in

	Witten, I.H., Neal, R. and Cleary, J.G. (1987) ``Arithmetic coding for
	data compression,'' Comm ACM: 30(6): 520-540; June;

for further discussion, see also

	Witten, I.H., Neal, R. and Cleary, J.G. (1988) ``Compress and compact
	discussed further,'' Comm ACM: 31(9): 1140, 1145; September (reply to a
	letter to the editor).

The code is also described in the book

	Bell, T.C., Cleary, J.G. and Witten, I.H. Text compression.
	Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1990.

There are three versions, each residing in a shar file in this directory:

    cacm-87.shar     The C code that was printed in the Comm ACM 1987 article
    fast-c.shar      The optimized C version that was mentioned in the article
    sun-assem.shar   An even faster version in 68000 assembly language.

Radford Neal has produced a new, experimental, version of the arithmetic coding
code that uses low precision division instead of the standard divide routine.
It resides as a shar archive in the subdirectory low.precision.version, and
includes its own README file.

This is take-it-or-leave-it code -- we don't have the resources to get involved
in helping you sort out technical problems.  However, we do know that lots of
people are using the cacm-87 code without problems.

Good luck!
